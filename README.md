**Status:** early development. Not playable.

## Requirements

- Fallout 4 **1.11.240** (Steam)
- [F4SE](https://f4se.silverlock.org/) 0.7.9
- [Address Library for F4SE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/47327) (1.11.240 version)

## Building

Needs Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop development with C++), Git, and [xmake](https://xmake.io) 3.0+.

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Jolley71717/F4Multiplayer
cd F4Multiplayer
xmake config -m releasedbg
xmake build
```

The plugin is written to `build/windows/x64/releasedbg/F4Multiplayer.dll`. Copy it to `Data/F4SE/Plugins/`, or set `XSE_FO4_MODS_PATH` (mod manager mods folder) or `XSE_FO4_GAME_PATH` and run `xmake install`.

## Roadmap

3. Animations, equipment, appearance
4. Combat between players
5. NPC / world sync
